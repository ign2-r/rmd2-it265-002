#### Goals for this Module
- [x] Figure out ways to put card/board game spin on bowling
- [x] Figure out color palette for game


#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Explored different ways to integrate card mechanics into a bowling-based game concept
  - Researched color schemes that balance visibility and aesthetics for potential game UI
  - Drafted a rough outline for how the core gameplay loop could work
- **Challenges faced**:
  - N/A
- **Solutions**:
  - N/A

#### Learnings
- Found that hybrid game mechanics (board game + sports) require careful balancing to feel fair
- Discovered potential ways to introduce variety without overcomplicating mechanics

#### Free Thinking
- What if the game had a draft system where players build a "strategy deck" before playing?

<!--

- Example prompts:
  - "What if the player interactions were asynchronous instead of real-time?"
  - "How could ECS improve performance in this system?"
  - "Does my current design support scalability? How can it improve?"
  
-->

#### Next Steps
- Refine the concept further with more research on similar game structures
- Draft potential gameplay scenarios to test different mechanics
- Explore how randomness could be adjusted to encourage strategic decision-making
