#### Goals for this Module  
- [x] Explore how difficulty scaling could work without just adding randomness  
- [x] Look into different probability ranges for dice-based mechanics  
- [ ] Start drafting a rough scoring system that rewards both skill and strategy  

#### Progress  
- **What I accomplished**:  
  - Looked into how other games handle difficulty scaling without making the game frustrating  
  - Thought about different ways dice-based mechanics could influence pin knockdowns  
  - Considered how card effects could interact with difficulty scaling  

- **Challenges faced**:  
  - Still not sure how to balance skill vs. randomness in a way that feels fair  
  - Some difficulty modifiers seem like they could make the game frustrating instead of engaging  

- **Solutions**:  
  - Maybe allow players to influence dice rolls in some way instead of making outcomes purely random  
  - N/A  

#### Learnings  
- Too much randomness can make players feel like their choices don’t matter, but too little makes it predictable  
- Some existing games use a system where difficulty adapts based on player performance, which could be interesting  

#### Free Thinking  
- What if players could “bank” certain dice rolls or rerolls as a resource?  
- Would it make sense for lane conditions to slightly influence dice outcomes instead of directly deciding them?  

#### Next Steps  
- Start drafting a loose idea of how scoring could work with both skill-based and luck-based elements
