#### Goals  
- Begin laying the foundation for a digital version of Bowl Champs  
- Identify which physical elements can translate cleanly into digital mechanics  
- Explore possible platforms and tools for prototyping  

#### Progress  
- Sketched out early UI concepts for card layout, player bucks, and score tracking  
- Made a list of all game elements that would need to be interactive (dice roller, card play, bucks counter)  
- Built a simple dice roller in JavaScript to test digital randomness  

#### Challenges  
- Figuring out how to keep the digital version true to the board game without losing the tactile feel  
- Still deciding between web-based implementation or a game engine like Unity  

#### Next Steps  
- Build a basic clickable prototype to simulate one full frame (card play, dice roll, bucks earned)  
- Research libraries for drag-and-drop or simple animations for the card interactions  
- Write logic to calculate bucks based on rolls and card effects
