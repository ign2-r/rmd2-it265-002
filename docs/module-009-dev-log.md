#### Goals  
- Start piecing together a functional digital frame of Bowl Champs using the rough components from last week  
- Test how the card mechanic, dice roller, and bucks tracker might interact in a single round  
- Get a better sense of pacing and flow for the digital version  

#### Progress  
- Took the separate dice roller and card click test and set up a minimal prototype simulating one frame  
- Added basic logic that lets a card be selected before a roll, and rewards a set buck value after  
- Built a placeholder “frame summary” that shows how many bucks were earned that round  

#### Challenges  
- No visual polish; still using text and console logs to track what’s happening  
- Didn’t fully hook up card effects to roll outcomes yet, just static tests  
- Still unsure if it’s better to keep building on this web setup or switch to Unity later  

#### Next Steps  
- Connect card effects more directly to dice outcomes  
- Polish the one-frame prototype enough to feel like an actual game turn  
- Explore lightweight animation options to give the game some life (maybe CSS or JS-based for now)
