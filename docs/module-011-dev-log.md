#### Goals for this Module

- [x] Come up with way of introducing skill into gameplay
- [x] Create all assets in Paint.NET
- [x] Hammer out final digital prototype

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - I decided to switch last minute from Unity 3D development to HTML
  - I developed a click-and-drag feature that allows for skill to be considered in gameplay
  - I created several different unique assets to make the environment immersive and realistic to a bowling alley
  - I developed a scoring system to realisticaly reflect bowling rules
  - I developed a system to reflect knocked pins upon rolling a ball
  
- **Challenges faced**:
  - It was a struggle to create the click-and-drag mechanic that wasn't finnicky
  - The tenth frame scoring mechanic kept bugging
  - Scoring in general kept bugging
  - Card mechanics were extremely difficult to implement
- **Solutions**:
  - Had to do extensive research on how to incorporate bowling scoring in JS
  - Decided to scrap the card stuff for the digital prototype

#### Learnings
- I learned how to do animations in CSS and JS

#### Next Steps
- Figure out how to work the card mechanics without completely breaking the game
- Hopefully graduate
